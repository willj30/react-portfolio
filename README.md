  ## Description
 For this project I have created a portfolio using React that includes a Sidebar to navigate Home, About, Portfolio, Contact, and links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Instagram. You will find my skills on the about page along with my github activity, a few of my recent projects in the portfolio page, and an interactive map of where I live on the contact page.
